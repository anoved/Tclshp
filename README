Tclshp
------

A Tcl interface to Shapelib's sample create, add, and dump utilities.

Tclshp 0.1 was released by Devin J. Eyre in 2006. This fork consists of an
updated and somewhat simplified distribution developed by Jim DeVona in 2012.

Compiling
---------

1. Edit `SHAPELIB_PREFIX` and `TCL_PREFIX` in Makefile to specify correct paths.
2. Type 'make' to generate tclshp.o and Tclshp.dylib

Installation
------------

Put Tclshp.dylib somewhere in your Tcl `auto_path` and load it with
`package require Tclshp`. To run from the current directory, call
`lappend auto_path .` first. Alternatively, just call `load Tclshp.dylib`.

Syntax
------

Examine the `test.tcl` test script for a simple syntax example of all eight
Tclshp commands (`::shp` and `::dbf` versions of `::create`, `::add`, `::info`,
and `::get`). See documentation of Tclshp 0.1 in Tclshp.pdf for more details.
